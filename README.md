This Repository is for the Python challenge and the PyBank Challenge. I  created a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company. I was provided with a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Based off the dataset I was able to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:The total number of months included in the dataset,The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes,The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
In the PyPoll Challenge, I was tasked with creating a modernized voting count process for a small, rural town.
I was provided with a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I was able to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:The total number of votes cast, A complete list of candidates who received votes, The percentage of votes each candidate won, The total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
